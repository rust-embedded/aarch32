# Macros for `aarch32-rt`

This crate contains proc-macros that are re-exported through the `aarch32-rt` crate

[aarch32-rt]: https://crates.io/crates/aarch32-rt

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.83.0 and up, as recorded
by the `package.rust-version` property in `Cargo.toml`.

Increasing the MSRV is not considered a breaking change and may occur in a
minor version release (e.g. from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1`, because this is still a
`0.x` release).
