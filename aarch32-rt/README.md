# Run-time support for Arm Cortex-R (AArch32)

This library implements a simple Arm vector table, suitable for getting into a
Rust application running in System Mode. It also provides a reference start
up method. Most Cortex-R based systems will require chip specific start-up
code, so the start-up method can be overridden.

See <https://docs.rs/cortex-r-rt> for detailed documentation.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.83.0 and up, as recorded
by the `package.rust-version` property in `Cargo.toml`.

Increasing the MSRV is not considered a breaking change and may occur in a
minor version release (e.g. from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1`, because this is still a
`0.x` release).
